7. 5v Power supply
8. Container for Sanitizer

Working-

The ultrasonic sensors of the automatic hand sanitizer dispenser detect the obstacle in front of it. 
When hands are placed in the front ultrasonic sensor, the ultrasound quickly fluctuates. 
This fluctuation causes a voltage variation that can be detected by microcontroller such as arduino which then triggers the pump to activate and dispense the designated amount of sanitizer. 
Led is also triggered on and off with pump for indication.
